# Level14
There are no useful looking files in our home directory this time around. Suppose that means it's time to dive straight into the `getflag` executable with gdb!

Over 1000 bytes worth of instructions... let's grab the executable and decompile it with Ghidra instead to have something a little more readable.

```c

```

We see many calls to the `ft_des` function which also appeared in the level13 executable.
